ONLY follow the following instructions if explicitly told:

<!-- .1 Task -->

app/api/calendar/route.js still gets the data from the db directly, but i want the zustand store to be the single source of truth for this app. update this so the calendar/route.js gets its data from the zustand state. 

<!-- .2 Disclaimer -->

Don`t make any other changes then the ones explicitly mentioned here or in any of the mentioned instruction-files.
Follow DECISIONS.md, CLAUDE.md, STYLE-GUIDE.md
