ONLY follow the following instructions if explicitly told:

<!-- .1 Task -->

**Only in the /admin page!!**
First create a branch on GitHub call it "admin/calendar" and so we can later push changes to this branch.

Then @"/admin.page.js" between the "New Gigs" button and the table display a calendar. Feel free to install a simple library that can easily be styled with css. 
The calendar should display all gigs that are stored in the DB under the table "concerts" schema "resresres". NOTE: these gigs are already fetched and displayed on this page, so use that data. 
When clicking on a date, the ".admn-panel-form" should open with the corresponding date already inserted. 

<!-- .2 Disclaimer -->

Don`t make any other changes then the ones explicitly mentioned here or in any of the mentioned instruction-files.
Follow DECISIONS.md, CLAUDE.md, STYLE-GUIDE.md
