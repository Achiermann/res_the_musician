ONLY follow the following instructions if explicitly told:

<!-- .1 Task -->

In CSS in the end of every .css file write a "mobile display" template as the following
"
/* .1.        MOBILE                                                                             */

@media (max-width: 768px){}
"

Then in "@media (max-width: 768px){}" change all styling so its displayed well in a mobile screen. 

<!-- .2 Disclaimer -->

Don`t make any other changes then the ones explicitly mentioned here or in any of the mentioned instruction-files.
Follow DECISIONS.md, CLAUDE.md, STYLE-GUIDE.md
