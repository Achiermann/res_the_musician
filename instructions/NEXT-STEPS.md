ONLY follow the following instructions if explicitly told:

<!-- .1 Task -->

I updated the DB-table "concerts". I added start, end, and url. 

create table resresres.concerts (
  id bigint generated by default as identity not null,
  created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
  act character varying not null,
  date date not null,
  venue character varying not null,
  location character varying not null,
  comments text not null,
  status text not null,
  start time without time zone null,
  end time without time zone null,
  url text null,
  constraint concerts_pkey primary key (id)
) TABLESPACE pg_default;

Add the new columns to the AdminPanel.js so the user can now as well send start, end and url to the db via the ui. 
Adjust all uploads so these new colums also get pushed.

<!-- .2 Disclaimer -->

Don`t make any other changes then the ones explicitly mentioned here or in any of the mentioned instruction-files.
Follow DECISIONS.md, CLAUDE.md, STYLE-GUIDE.md
