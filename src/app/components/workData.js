    description: 'Progressing from the angular, snappy sounds of the band’s 2018 «Jonglage» album, the Sauvage EP breathes an atmosphere of wonder and possibility. Dreamy and psychedelic, each song is delivered with the band’s signature lyricism, playfulness, and measured optimism. From the tender and naive Breakfast in Bed to the bittersweet headiness of Delicate High, Sauvage is a little world of wonder, humour, and hope. credits released June 30, 2020 Written and produced by Beda Mächler, Andreas Achermann, Linus Gmünder Supported by Kanton Schwyz, Kanton Zug, C. & A. Kupper-Stiftung Mixed by Giuliano Sulzberger Mastered by Richard Dodd Artwork by Beda Mächler',
